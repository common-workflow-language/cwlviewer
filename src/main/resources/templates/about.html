            <h1>Privacy policy</h1>
            <p>CWL Viewer publishes visualizations of workflows from publicly available 
            <em>git</em> repositories hosted by third-parties like <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>
            or <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">gitlab.com</a>.             
            Anyone can submit a workflow, which will be added 
            to our <a href="/workflows">public listing</a>.

            <h2>Tracking usage</h2>
            <p>
            We do not track individual users of CWL Viewer, but we do record 
            general usage (e.g. web server access log) 
            for operational purposes and to prevent abuse.            
            We may use HTTP session cookies in order to assist 
            workflow submission, but do not use cookies to identify users.

            <h2>What information is held?</h2>
			<p>
			We hold information about public open source workflows in order 
			to visualize them graphically and textually, as well as making their 
			declared metadata accessible to the public in different formats such as linked data.
			This information may be held until explicitly requested for removal, however
			we reserve the right to remove any workflow from listing without prior notice.
			</p>
            <p>
            Metadata shown from the public workflows may include personal data, 
            including authorship or as part of workflow descriptions. 
            We retrieve this information from the submitted git repository.       
            Downloading a workflow or its metadata may include 
            information from the git repository not otherwise
            shown in the CWL Viewer interface, e.g. authors from git commit history. 
            </p>
            <p>
            For performance reasons the CWL Viewer may keep a copy of the 
            checked out git repository and the derived metadata. 
            We may at a later date retrieve published changes 
            from the original repository to update the information held.

            <h2>Where is information exposed?</h2>
            <p>
            Workflows and their metadata can be accessed in CWL Viewer through
            the <a href="/workflows">public listing</a> by browsers, 
            programmaticaly through the <a href="/apidocs">API</a>, and 
            can be downloaded in multiple formats like ZIP, SVG or RDF.

            CWL Viewer generates and exposes <a href="https://w3id.org/cwl/view/">permalinks</a>
            which reference the git <em>commit</em> and the workflow <em>path</em> 
            within the git repository, but not the git repository location or username.             
            These permalinks are only resolvable with
            the public <a href="https://view.commonwl.org/">https://view.commonwl.org/</a> 
            if it has previously visualized a corresponding public git repository.

		<section id="best-practice">
            <h1>Best Practices</h1>
            <p>In order to ensure that your workflow is well presented in CWL Viewer, we recommend the following of
            <a href="http://www.commonwl.org/user_guide/rec-practices/">CWL Best Practices</a>. Those which are
                specifically relevant to the viewer are detailed below, but it is suggested that you try to meet as
                many as possible to include the general quality and reproducibility of your workflows.</p>
            <p>Some limitations of the CWL Viewer which you may need to be aware of are also described here.</p>

            <section id="label">
            <h2>Label Strings</h2>
            <p class="recommendation">Include a top level short <code>label</code> summarising each tool and workflow</p>
            <p class="why">Labels give the user an easy human-readable version of the name for the tool or workflow</p>
            <p class="use">For workflows this will be displayed at the top of the page as the title and for tools it will be
                displayed in the table and as the name of the step in the visualisation. If a <code>label</code>
                is given at the step level, it will take priority over the top level tool <code>label</code>. You can
                use this to provide a more descriptive label of the tool's application in the particular step if
                preferred.</p>
			</section>                

			<section id="conceptual">
            <h2 id="doc">Doc Strings</h2>
            <p class="recommendation">If useful, include a top level <code>doc</code> string providing a longer, more detailed description
                than was provided in the <code>label</code> (see above)</p>
            <p class="why">Docs give the user a detailed description of the role a tool or workflow performs</p>
            <p class="use">For workflows this will be displayed at the top of the page under the title and for tools it will be
                displayed in the table. If a <code>doc</code> string is given at the step level, it will take priority
                over the top level tool doc. You can use this to provide a more descriptive label of the tool's
                application in the particular step if preferred</p>
            </section>

			<section id="conceptual">
            <h2>Conceptual Identifiers</h2>
            <p class="recommendation">All <code>input</code> and <code>output</code> identifiers should reflect their conceptual identity.
               Generic and uninformative names such as <code>result</code> or <code>input</code>/<code>output</code>
               should be avoided</p>
            <p class="why">Helpful identifiers allow for the links between steps in the CWL file to be easily distinguished</p>
            <p class="use">Identifiers are displayed in the tables and are unique to the step. The <code>label</code> is also
            used as a replacement for the identifier in the visualisation if provided.</p>
            </section>

			<section id="format">
            <h2>Format Specification</h2>
            <p class="recommendation">The <code>format</code> field should be specified for all input and output <code>File</code>s</p>
            <p class="recommendation_more">
                Tools should use format identifiers from a relevant ontology such as the
                <a href="http://edamontology.org/format_1915">EDAM Ontology</a> in the case of Bioinformatics tools.
                For plain types use the
                <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml">IANA media type list</a> with
                <code>$namespaces: { iana: "https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/" }</code>, for example
                <code>iana:text/plain</code>, <code>iana:text/tab-separated-values</code>
            </p>
            <p class="why">The use of formal standards for format fields enables implementations to provide checks
            for compatibility in formatting of files</p>
            <p class="use">Ontologies will be parsed and the name of and link to the format displayed in the table on workflow
                pages. Plain formats will have the iana.org link given but will not display the name of the format.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="separation-of-concerns"> 
            <h2>Separation of Concerns</h2>
            <p class="recommendation">Each <code>CommandLineTool</code> description should focus on a single operation only, even if the
                (sub)command is capable of more.</p>
            <p class="why">This allows for easier reuse of the tool in other workflows and understanding as to it's purpose</p>
            <p class="use">In CWL Viewer this ensures that steps are clear in purpose within the workflow and generated visualisation</p>

            <h2 id="javascript">JavaScript Elimination</h2>
            <p class="recommendation">Evaluate all use of JavaScript for possible elimination or replacement. For instance, for the
                manipulation of <code>File</code> names and paths, often one of the built in <code>File</code>
                properties such as <code>basename</code>, <code>nameroot</code>, <code>nameext</code> etc
                could be used instead</p>
            <p class="why">Tool runners can implement more efficient implementations of built in functionality, which
                makes JavaScript expressions a last resort</p>
            <p class="use">CWL viewer does not take into account JavaScript expressions when extracting information about your
                workflows</p>
            </section>

			<section id="subworkflows">
            <h2>Use of Subworkflows</h2>
            <p class="recommendation">CWL implementations which also implement <code>SubworkflowFeatureRequirement</code> can support nesting
            workflows as a step within others. Complex workflows with individual components which can be abstracted
            should utilise this to make their workflow modular and allow sections of them to be easily reused</p>
            <p class="why">Extracting subworkflows enables them to be run, developed on and tested individually. It also makes
                them able to be understood more easily</p>
            <p class="use">Subworkflows are simplified in the visualisations and are linked as a different workflow in the
            <code>Step</code> tables on each workflow page</p>
            </section>

			<section id="attribution">
            <h2>Attribution</h2>
            <p class="recommendation">Include attribution information in your workflow and tool descriptions</p>
            <p class="recommendation_more">
                For example, to attribute a person as the author of a workflow or tool with name, email and
                ORCID information, include the following statements at the top level:<br />
<pre>
$namespaces: { s: "http://schema.org/" }
s:author:
- class: s:Person
  s:name: Mark Robinson
  s:email: mailto:mark@example.com

                as an example
            </p>
            <p class="why">Attribution information allows your workflows and tooling to be used by others while
            recognising your contributions. The inclusion of an <a href="https://orcid.org/">ORCID</a> allows you to
            be uniquely identified from other researchers</p>
            <p class="use">CWLViewer parses attribution information for inclusion in the Research Object Manifest from
            both the Git commit logs and from the CWL descriptions themselves when expressed in the
            <a href="http://schema.org/author">http://schema.org/author</a> format as above</p>
            </section>

			<section  id="licensing">
            <h2>Licensing</h2>
            <p class="recommendation">Include a <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses">OSI approved open source license</a>
            in your workflow and tool descriptions</p>
            <p class="recommendation_more">
                For example, the following two statements at the top level of a workflow or tool description licenses it
                under the <a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache V2.0 License</a>:<br />
<pre>

</pre>
            </p>
            
            <p class="why">A permissive open source license allows others to remix and use your tooling and workflows
            to prevent the community from repeating development effort, allowing everyone to benefit</p>
            <p class="use">CWL Viewer is designed to allow people to locate and make use of the workflows developed by
            others as well as to share and demonstrate work, and open source licenses promote this goal</p>

		<section id="limitations"> 
            <h1>Limitations</h1>
            <h2>Research Objects</h2>
            <p>Research Objects are constructed from the containing directory of the workflow file. This means tooling
                external to the directory but used by the workflow will not be included
                (<a href="https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwlviewer/issues/103">see Github issue</a>)</p>
            <p>We recommend that you keep all files in the containing folder for current use of CWL Viewer</p>

            <h2 id="ssh">SSH Cloning</h2>
            <p>SSH URLs are not able to be cloned or used as submodules due to the need for SSH keys to be set up.</p>
            <p>We do not plan SSH support due to the impact on reproducibility from this being made a required
            step to download the workflow.</p>

            <h2 id="others">Others</h2>
            <p>Other limitations or unimplemented features can be viewed
