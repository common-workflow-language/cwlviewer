# CWL Viewer

This is a [Spring Boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) MVC application which fetches [Common Workflow Language](http://www.commonwl.org/) files from a Github repository and creates a page for it detailing the main workflow and its inputs, outputs and steps.

# Using CWL Viewer

You are recommended to use the **production instance** of CWL Viewer at https://view.commonwl.org/ which runs the latest [release](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwlviewer/releases). Any downtime should be reported on the [gitter chat for cwlviewer](https://gitter.im/common-workflow-language/cwlviewer). 

The **dev instance** at http://view.commonwl.org:8082/ corresponds to the current `master` branch, and is updated every 6 minutes to run the latest [commonworkflowlanguage/cwlviewer docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/commonworkflowlanguage/cwlviewer/builds/). Note that this instance is NOT secured and might break at any time.

# Running

If you are a developer, or you want to use the CWL Viewer in a closed environment, then you can run your own instance.

## Recommended - Running with Docker

This application can be started with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

To start CWLViewer exposed on port `8080`, run:

    docker-compose up

To stop and remove:

    docker-compose down

If you change the source code, then use this `docker-compose.override.yml` and 
re-build with `docker-compose build`:

```yaml
version: '3.2'
services:
  spring:
    build: .
```

See the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) file for details.

If you have modified the source code, then you may want to build the docker image locally first:

    docker build -t commonworkflowlanguage/cwlviewer .

## Running without Docker

### Requirements

#### MongoDB

You will need to have [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) running,
by default on `localhost:27017`

If you are running from the command line, you can override this by supplying
system properties like `-Dspring.data.mongodb.host=mongo.example.org` and
`-Dspring.data.mongodb.port=1337`

#### Apache Jena Fuseki (or alternative SPARQL server)

You will also need to have a SPARQL server such as [Apache Jena Fuseki](https://jena.apache.org/documentation/fuseki2/) running, 
by default on `localhost:3030`

## Compiling and Running

To compile you will need [Java 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) or OpenJDK 8 (`apt install openjdk-8-jdk`),
as well as [Apache Maven 3](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) (`apt install maven`).

Spring Boot uses an embedded HTTP server. The Spring Boot Maven plugin includes a run goal which can be used to quickly compile and run it:

```
$ mvn spring-boot:run
```


Alternatively, you can run the application from your IDE as a simple Java application by importing the Maven project.

You need to install [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/) for all unit tests to pass.

You can create an executable JAR file by using:

    mvn clean install

Afterwards, run:

    java -jar target/cwlviewer*.jar

(The exact filename will vary per version)

Once CWL Viewer is running, you should see log output somewhat like:

```
()..)
s.b.c.e.t.TomcatEmbeddedServletContainer : Tomcat started on port(s): 8080 (http)
org.researchobject.CwlViewerApplication  : Started CwlViewerApplication in 28.604 seconds
```

Now check out http://localhost:8080/ to access CWL Viewer.

## Configuration

There are a variety of configuration options detailed in the [application configuration file](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwlviewer/blob/master/src/main/resources/application.properties) which can be adjusted.

When deploying with docker, these can be overriden externally by creating/modifying `docker-compose.override.yml` as follows:

```yaml
version: '3.2'
services:
  spring:
    environment:
            applicationName: Common Workflow Language Viewer
            applicationURL: https://view.commonwl.org
            cacheDays: 1
```

The properties can alternatively be provided as system properties on the
command line, e.g. `-DcacheDays=1` or via a [variety of other methods supported by Spring Boot](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-external-config.html)
